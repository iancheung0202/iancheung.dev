    <ul>
        <li>We may share your personal information with our parent companies, subsidiaries, and affiliates;</li>
        <li>We may share your personal information when we have a good faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary to (a) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request, (b) enforce a Customer Agreement, including investigation of potential violations thereof, or (c) protect against imminent harm to our rights, property or safety, or that of our users or the public as required or permitted by law;</li>

If we are required under applicable law to treat such information as personal information, then we will only disclose it as described above. Otherwise, we may disclose such information for any reason.</p>

    <h2>Disclosure of Your Information of Third Parties</h2>

    <p>Our Websites may also contain links to third-party websites. This Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected by us. Even if the third party is affiliated with us through a business partnership or otherwise, we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such third parties. We have no control or management over the contents of such other third parties or their privacy policies or compliance with the law. We encourage you to familiarize yourself with the privacy policies of such third parties to determine how they handle any information they separately collect from you. Please be aware that we do not warn you when you choose to click through to another website when using Our Websites.</p>

    <h2>Your Controls and Choices</h2>

    <p><span>Refusal.</span> You have the right to refuse to provide your personal information and/or of having your personal information used for certain purposes upon our request. If you decide to refuse, we may be unable to provide certain features of our Websites to you.</p>
    <p><span>Communication Preferences.</span> If you no longer wish to receive our newsletter and promotional communications, you can unsubscribe simply by returning email, clearly stating that you do not prefer . Please note, however, that you may be unable to stop receiving certain types of communications.</p>
    <p><span>Blocking Cookies.</span> Like any other website, iancheung.dev uses cookies. These cookies are used to store information including visitors' preferences, and the pages on the website that the visitor accessed or visited. The information is used to optimize the users' experience by customizing our web page content based on visitors' browser type and/or other information. You can remove or block certain cookies using the settings in your browser but our Websites may cease to function properly if you do so.</p>
    <p><span>Do Not Track Signals.</span> Your browser may have a do not track setting which, when enabled, causes your browser to send a do not track HTTP header file signal to each site you visit. At present, our Websites do not respond to this type of signal.</p>

    <h2>Security</h2>

    <p>The security of your personal information is crucial to us. We maintain a variety of appropriate technical and organizational safeguards to protect your personal information. We limit access to personal information about you to agents who we believe reasonably need to come into contact with that information to provide products or services to you. Further, we have implemented reasonable physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards designed to protect personal information about you, and at the same time, to protect the base of our Websites, for example, Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS). When you visit our Websites, or even enter sensitive information (such as your password), we encrypt all of your personal information in transit using the industry-standard Transport Layer Security (TLS) encryption technology. However, no method of transmission over the Internet, method of electronic storage or other security methods are one hundred percent secure. Therefore, while we strive to use our best efforts to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>

    <h2 id="Accessing-and-Updating-Your-Personal-Information">Accessing and Updating Your Personal Information</h2>

    <p>When you use our Websites, we make great efforts to provide you with access to your personal information upon your request and either provide you with the chance to correct this information if it is inaccurate or to delete such information at your request if it is not otherwise required to be retained by law or for legitimate business purposes. You may access, review, correct, update, change or delete your information at any time. To do so, please contact us via any of the methods listed <a href="../" target="_blank">here</a> with your name and the information requested to be accessed, corrected or removed. We may decline to process requests that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate technical effort (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup servers), jeopardize the privacy of others, would be extremely impractical, or for which access is not otherwise required. In any case, where we provide information access and correction, we perform this service free of charge, except if doing so would require a disproportionate effort.</p>

    <p>If you make a request, we have one month to respond to you.</p>

    <h2>Children's Information</h2>

    <p>Another part of our priority is adding protection for children while using the internet. We encourage parents and guardians to observe, participate in, and/or monitor and guide their online activity.</p>

    <p>We do not knowingly collect any Personal Identifiable Information from children under the age of 13. If you think that your child provided this kind of information on our Websites, we strongly encourage you to contact us immediately and we will do our best efforts to promptly remove such information from our records.</p>
