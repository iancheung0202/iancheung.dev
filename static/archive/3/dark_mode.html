         <p><small style="text-align: justify; color: #dfdfdf;">Ian Cheung is a passionate website developer and Discord bot programmer. It was actually the onset of the pandemic and the shift to online schooling that prompted his interest in coding. Having his routine disrupted, Ian felt compelled to learn something new, particularly with the abundance of free time available due to online schooling. Thus, he began dedicating his evenings and weekends to constructing (very poorly made) websites. Having had exposure to coding at primary school such as Scratch and Micro:bit since a young age, he had actually never considered it to be something he would greatly pursue, but instead something on the side as a hobby. However, the aspects of being a developer became more intriguing over time, most notably the ability to create a product he or someone could use. </small></p>
         <p><small style="text-align: justify; color: #dfdfdf;">Every day, Ian wake up thirsty and passionate to accelerate my understanding of this constantly evolving field that is hugely satisfying to comprehend. Mastering computer programming allows him to think independently, solve problems and be resilient when facing seemingly impossible challenges. Ian is also very eager to explore more about development outside of class to accelerate his learning and improve his abilities. Currently being a self-motivated high school student, Ian is enthusiastic about the potential of technology in the foreseeable future. With a solid foundation in computer programming, as well as strong organization and leadership skills, Ian is also dedicated to expanding his experience regarding programming. He also enjoys working as a tutor to young kids about coding and robotics in the community.</small></p>

         <p><small style="text-align: justify; color: #dfdfdf;">Violinist Ian Cheung joined the San Francisco Symphony Youth Orchestra in 2023. Born in Hong Kong, he previously studied with Professor Michael Ma and Ms. Li Junjun. He currently studies under the tutelage of Professor Chen Zhao of the San Francisco Symphony.</small></p>

         <p><small style="text-align: justify; color: #dfdfdf;">Ian first grasped the beauty of classical music and compositions during his toddler years when his mother frequently played Mozart's “Eine Kleine Nachtmusik” on a CD player at home. At the age of six, Ian began learning the violin and joined his primary school’s orchestra soon after. Since then, Ian has been actively participating in school orchestras every year and making steady progress. He became the Co-Principal first violin of the Senior Strings Orchestra and Symphony Orchestra in his primary school, partaking in a performance tour in Taipei with the school in 2018. At the age of ten, he entered the Hong Kong Academy for Performing Arts (HKAPA), marking the beginning of his professional music education. Ian was the principal violinist of the Junior Strings Ensemble and Junior Repertoire Ensemble in HKAPA under the baton of Mr. Goh Ching.</small></p>
          
         <p><small style="text-align: justify; color: #dfdfdf;">Ian attained the Fellowship Trinity College London (FTCL) for Violin Performance in 2022. He has also won accolades in various local competitions, including the 74th Hong Kong Schools Music Festival in 2021 – Violin Concerto - Age 19 or under, the 4th Taiwan Asia Aegean Sea Music International Competition in 2020 – Hong Kong Preliminary Round in Violin Open Class D, International Young Artist Music Contest in 2020, Tokyo International Youth Music Competition 2020 Strings Intermediate Class, the 6th Hong Kong International Youth Performance Arts Festival in Violin Open Class in Youth A Class 2018, and the 10th Hong Kong Students Open Music Competition 2017 – Violin Grade 8.</small></p>
          
         <p><small style="text-align: justify; color: #dfdfdf;">In 2022, Ian moved to the SF Bay Area with his parents. He is currently studying under Prof. Chen Zhao, and is a student at the San Francisco Conservatory of Music Pre-college Academy. He was also a member of the California All-State of Music Education Conference (CASMEC) High School Symphony Orchestra 2023 at Fresno Convention Center. In the previous summer, Ian attended C’est Bon Chamber Music Academy. Moreover, he has also been participating in Gunn High School’s instrumental music program, including the Chamber Orchestra as well as Symphony Orchestra, where he holds the position of concertmaster for the 2023-2024 school year. Ian is very passionate about performing both solo and orchestral pieces from various genres. Beyond classical music, Ian enjoys computer programming, video games, music composition, and listening to music. Ian hopes that he can combine and apply his knowledge in both music and computer science to inspire individuals to use technology as a medium to embrace, share and create. </small></p>

        <p><small style="text-align: justify; color: #dfdfdf;">Rarely do I actually play the game itself, I instead handle everything from server administration and moderation to organizing events for others to enjoy. As an owner of the server, I think through every nitty-gritty detail, from scheduling and logistics to potential hiccups and backup plans. My goal is to make sure every event runs smoothly, leaving everyone participating with a positive experience. My organizational skills and community-building efforts have even allowed me to host interviews with renowned voice actors. I have the honor to invite <a href="https://youtu.be/zul2qZJ-MkQ" target="_blank">Sean Chiplock</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/aDiX_Xm_JUY" target="_blank">Chelsea Kwoka</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/JY4m89iy3Co" target="_blank">Christina Costello</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/d8CFvV77a1Q" target="_blank">Brittany Cox</a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/X8J8kIC6bPk" target="_blank">Andrew Russell</a> to interviews and podcasts, where other individuals can directly interact with them and ask them questions. These events were huge successes, with hundreds of participants tuning in to learn from and interact directly with these talented individuals. So, while I might not be organizing events in a traditional setting, I'm confident that my behind-the-scenes skills make me a valuable asset to any community. I believe I am a natural leader, a problem-solver, and a master of planning and execution, allowing me to complete any project very effectively and efficiently.

           <p style="color: #dfdfdf;">Every Saturday, my parents would drive me 35 miles north to San Francisco to attend SFCM Pre-College. We have small chamber ensembles, musicianship classes, and private lessons, all on the same day. On top of that, there are a lot of masterclasses and performance opportunities available. Throughout the year, I have grown a lot, not just as a musician, but as a whole person.

           <p style="color: #dfdfdf;">Many people say that calculus lacks practicality in everyday scenarios. However, as I progressed to more advanced levels of mathematical coursework, I began to see an increase in relevance in the modern world, and the practical utility of calculus became increasingly apparent. The most memorable problem I remember is to determine the dimensions of a rectangular box situated within a sphere of radius 1 cm, while maximizing the box's volume. Despite the seemingly straightforward nature of the problem, it involves complicated mathematical concepts, such as the application of maxima and derivatives within the context of functions characterized by three variables. After many steps, we will reach the final answer of (<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>√3</sub>, <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>√3</sub>, <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>√3</sub>), suggesting that the box is a cube with sides <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>√3</sub> cm, thus, matching our intuition that the box will be a cube. </p>
