      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p> I am a website developer who was born in Hong Kong and now living in California. I am currently 15 years old and studying in high school. Besides website developing, my favourite hobbies include playing the violin, the piano and some sports like cycling. I have advanced music technique. Given that, I have won lots of local advanced competitions and recently passed and was awarded Merit in the LTCL Performance diploma exam in Trinity College, London. Besides that, I am also an exceptionally knowledgable video editor.</p>
      <p>I personally believe that I am no ordinary student. Noticing that I was having trouble continuing my same life which has been on-going for a few years already, therefore, I suspected I should start to learn a new technique. As a result, in the evenings and weekends I started to build websites. Having done coding since I was small, I had actually never considered it to be something I would greatly pursue, but instead something on the side for fun. As time goes on, the aspects of being a developer became more intriguing, most notably being able to create a product I or someone could use, and as well allow me to apply my entrepreneurship skills led me to make the switch over to pursue to be a professional website developer.</p>
      <p>Passionate about learning more about development outside of class to accelerate my learning and improve my skills, this website is used for me to learn more about front-end web development; and as well showcase the projects that I complete.</p>
      <p>Some things I'm proud of in my journey in switching so far: </p>
      <li>Creating my own personal mini-game <a href="https://www.ianbrawlstars.com/snake-game" target="_blank">(Snake Game)</a>, enhancing my JavaScript knowledge, as well as the front-end langauges including responsive CSS </li> 
      <li>Developing my own <a href="https://www.ianbrawlstars.com" target="_blank">website</a> </li>
      <li>Developing a multi-purpose ultility <a href="https://fm-genshin-cafe.github.io.fischl" target="_blank">Discord Bot</a> with various functions such as ticket tool  </li>

          <p>I've been working with lots of amazing and experienced graphics designers recently. Arjun is one of them. Arjun is a professional graphic designer who mostly do banners, logos, thumbnails, headers and advertisments. </p>
          <p>A website for a designer must be more appealing than a normal portfolio, so I took nearly 2 weeks to finish the project, despite the Easter holidays. Like any designer portfolio, designs showcase is very important. This website further enhances my knowledge and skills with Bootstrap and CSS, especailly with gradient.</p>

The website includes a wide range of elements that is relatively new to me, which are draggable elements, popup boxes, email subscribe form, share tab, animated footer (not GIF) and a scrolling indicator. I am very proud that in this project, I didn't apply any frameworks to it. It's simply self-coded by me.</p>
          <p>I've learned how to apply responsive CSS to the webpage, displaying the content differently on different devices and make sure they render properly. I have also further enhanced my skills with JavaScript and HTML. Looking to further develop more functions to improve the user experience.</p>

          <p>I am very honoured to be able to be the website developer for the famous community-wide assets providing Discord server, Brawl Assets. At the time this webpage was written, it has over 10,000 members.</p>
          <p>Since the client is exceptionally well-known and has a high reputation in the public, I strongly believe that creating a website from scratch won't be practical, thus, might not look professional. As a result, I chose to re-use what I've created for LT Gaming and made some changes to it. During this period, I was able to get myself more familiarize with the tools I used, such as jQuery and Bootstrap. In addition, I've applied Open Graph to the website for the first time.</p>
          <p>Frameworks & Tools: Bootstrap, jQuery, Data AOS, Owl Carousel</p>

          <p>Yes, it's another personal portfolio website, made for my another best friend, Vishva Sarvaiya. He is a famous Indian content creator. Given that, I've decided to give it a try to use at least framework as possible. </p>
          <p>Although the end product did not end up very fancy, it's still an admirable and unique style. This is also my first experience that allowed me to learn how to develop an full website from scratch, and as well continue to develop my skills with HTML and CSS. </p>

              <p>Learning to code has the extra benefit of not only making a candidate more employable but also giving them the freedom of starting their own business, setting up an online presence, making a professional portfolio or even creating a side income from making websites or apps! I strongly believe web design is full of creativity, fun, progression and skill. It is an ever-evolving subject that is hugely satisfying to learn and master. Learning how to develop websites provides a person with far more than an understanding of how to write code. It develops them as a person; it teaches them how to think independently, solve problems, be resilient in the face of seemingly impossible challenges and think outside of the box. For now, I only have time to publish the HTML part, and I believe more chapters will come soon!</p>
              <p>Before 2021, I've made my mind that this book will cost some money. However, realizing that so many people wanted to learn web design but they don't want to cost a penny at all, now, I will make this book free-to-access for everyone. Hope you guys find it interesting and helpful!</p>

          <p>Bill Russell is an amazingly talented voice actor with years of experience. Imagine the voice catalog of characters as diverse as Mel Blanc, with the acting ability of Jim Carrey, while still being able to cover an entire range of dynamic voice over needs. His ability to morph into this wide array of characters is what has landed him an animated feature; regional commercials; animated short films; video games; ten audiobooks; and over 130 children’s audiobooks. Most importantly, he has landed as the voice actor of Bull in Brawl Stars. Given that, Bill is relatively engaged in my Discord server and he chats with server members in the voice channels. He pretty much enjoyed the experience as he said that he loved talking to people.
